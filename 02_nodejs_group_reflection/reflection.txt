My Role:

Reflect on the role you were assigned in your group (Developer). Write about how you contributed to the project, 
what challenges you faced in this role, and what you learned.

  During our project I worked as a developer where I dedicated effort to both designing the codebase 
and creating plans. Being the lead developer allowed me to demonstrate my technical expertise because
I created the system architecture that proved essential to project success. This role demanded me to 
deepen my knowledge of programming. I assisted the team by designing the system itself.

  The biggest challenges for me is the internet connection and my deviceâ€™s limits. The experience helped 
me develop gratitude for the resources I possessed. I stumbled upon completely unfamiliar technical 
tools and terminology during that period. The overwhelming feeling turned into learning opportunities
when I took on the unfamiliar project sections.

  I had to learn and adjust my strategies as my computer introduced technological challenges so I started 
working with basic applications during system delays. A realization dawned on me that unlearned information
do not represent failure rather they present learning opportunities. The project taught me to become more 
efficient at solving problems across programming challenges and unexpected real-life situations.
  

Teamwork Experience:

Share your experience working as part of a team. What went well? What could be improved? Reflect on how well the team communicated, delegated tasks, and collaborated to achieve the project goals.


Personal Growth and Discipline:

Think about the disciplines you want to improve.

As a Developer, you might want to improve your coding efficiency or debugging skills. Reflect on how you plan to improve these skills moving forward.
