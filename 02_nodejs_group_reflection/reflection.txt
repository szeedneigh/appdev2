My Role:

  During our project I worked as a developer where I dedicated effort to both designing the codebase 
and creating plans. Being the lead developer allowed me to demonstrate my technical expertise because
I created the system architecture that proved essential to project success. This role demanded me to 
deepen my knowledge of programming. I assisted the team by designing the system itself.

  The biggest challenges for me is the internet connection and my device’s limits. The experience helped 
me develop gratitude for the resources I possessed. I stumbled upon completely unfamiliar technical 
tools and terminology during that period. The overwhelming feeling turned into learning opportunities
when I took on the unfamiliar project sections.

  I had to learn and adjust my strategies as my computer introduced technological challenges so I started 
working with basic applications during system delays. A realization dawned on me that unlearned information
do not represent failure rather they present learning opportunities. The project taught me to become more 
efficient at solving problems across programming challenges and unexpected real-life situations.
  

Teamwork Experience:

Our team did a solid job on this project. We focused on using everyone’s skills to get the best results—like 
assigning tasks based on what each person was good at. The meetings worked well as checkpoints: we’d update 
each other, fix problems together, and keep everyone on track. I also tried to motivate the team when things 
got tough, which helped us avoid big delays.

But the system design part was a hassle. Myself as a developer had to step in a lot to help the designers 
which took time away from coding. I think the designers need to brush up on design principles to handle their
tasks better next time.

During development, we ran into two main issues: one Git conflicts messed up our workflow sometimes, and two 
some of us (including my partner and me) weren’t fully comfortable with the tech stack, like ShadCn. I had to 
learn new tools quickly, which was tricky but paid off for the project.

Communication was mostly smooth, though we occasionally had small misunderstandings about the project details. 
Luckily, these weren’t personal—just confusion about tasks—and we fixed them by going back to the project goals 
together.

Overall, we did well, but I’d push for clearer workflows next time. Things like design guides or quick tech 
training could make everything run smoother.


Personal Growth and Discipline:

  I struggle with underestimating task times, resulting into distractions (instagram, random research), and 
inconsistent effort—swinging between hyper-focus and low motivation. Under pressure, I sacrifice sleep for
rushed work, leading to burnout.

Improvement Plan:
Schedule strictly: Time-block tasks, breaks, and distractions.
Limit interruptions: Use focus apps; tackle small daily goals.
Prioritize rest: Set a daily shutdown time.
